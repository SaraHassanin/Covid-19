# Covid-19
The project focuses on developing an AI platform that can analyze and provide valuable insights from COVID-19 data.The platform will utilize advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques to process large volumes of COVID-19-related data, including cases, mortality rates,injury rate, temperature, and more. The goal is to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and correlations from the data to aid in decision-making, policy formulation, and research efforts related to the pandemic.

About dataset:
the important features are (date,country,temperature,ConfirmedCases,Fatalities,slp,dewp,rh,wdsp) 
**link to dataset on kaggle is: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidbnn92/weather-data-for-covid19-data-analysis)
in our project we use the (training_data_with_weather_info_week_1) file

Key Components:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and quality for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the characteristics of the data, identify outliers, missing values, and perform descriptive statistics.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features like continent.
4. apply a dashboard to visulize information

By leveraging AI for COVID-19 data analysis, this project aims to harness the power of technology to improve our understanding of the pandemic and inform evidence-based responses for effective control and mitigation strategies.
